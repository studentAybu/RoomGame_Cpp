# 🕹️ Room Game – Simple Text-Based Adventure in C++

This is a basic object-oriented C++ project simulating a simple room-based adventure game. Players can choose between different character classes like Warrior, Wizard, or Rogue, each with unique attributes and abilities. Items like Swords and Potions can be used or stored in the character’s Inventory, allowing for interactive gameplay logic. The project uses abstract classes, interfaces (Usable), inheritance, and composition to demonstrate clean and modular C++ design principles. Ideal for beginners learning OOP concepts in C++.
